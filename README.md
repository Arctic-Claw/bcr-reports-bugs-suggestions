# BCR GitHub | Reports (Bugs + Suggestions + Questions)
Welcome to Brayford City's GitHub Respository! 
> This is where you report bugs so that we are able to fix them as fast as possible. As well as suggesting things that could be used later in the future. This space is dedicated to improving our [Brayford City Roleplay Discord Server](https://discord.gg/AJ3Ksxg3gS) by collecting community-driven feedback and tracking changes. Whether you’re staff, a guest, or community member, your voice helps shape the future of our server.

- 🐛 Bug Report --- Report server issues, broken features, or technical problems
- 💡 Suggestion/Feature Request --- Submit ideas, improvements, or new feature proposals
- ❓ Question / Support --- Ask for help, request clarification, or get support
> Each issue will be reviewed by staff, discussed if needed, and then approved, rejected, or scheduled for future development.

2) Click New Issue
3) Select the template that fits your need (Bug, Suggestion, Question)
